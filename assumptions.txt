Assumptions:

- a calendar already exists
- code is in github or a similar tool which facilitates code review
- people are sharing one screen during the meeting, either by sitting in one room or through webex/skype/etc.

Therefore, letsmeet does not:
- offer any scheduling functionality
- does not contain a review / code edit tool
- does not offer real-time collaborative editing
